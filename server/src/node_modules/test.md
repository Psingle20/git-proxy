# [Project Contribution] Git Proxy

## Business Problem

Many corporations, especially financial services have strict policies towards opensource contributions. On rare occasions when a developer can contribute to open source, information security and compliance officers often demand complex shadow processes are set up to ensure code reviews, scans, and other processes are adhered to before a push to the public repo takes place.

We wish to keep the process for the developer as simple and familiar as possible, therefore we feel the solution is a proxy that sits between the developer and the public repository.

## Proposed Solution

The idea is quite simple, scan outgoing attempts to push to public repositor and raise compliance/info-sec friendly checks before allowing the push to complete.

Of course, every corporation will have different procedures so a key feature has to be the extensibility of the framework.

## Current State

- Proof of concept publicly available on https://github.com/pGrovesy/github-proxy
- Overall discussion about the business problem is available at https://github.com/finos/open-developer-platform/discussions/163
- Morgan Stanley, ITAU and Citi expressed interest to contribute to the project

## Development Team

- Paul Groves

## MVP

- Chain of validations should be configurable (Mao)
- Email approval notification/approval (?)
- STP of Pull requests (Dov Katz)
- Authentication/Authorisation with Corporate systems
- Secrets Scanning (everyone)
- Content filter (checking messages/content for 'bad' words)

# Contribution Process

## Identify project meta

- [ ] Project Title
- [ ] Category and sub-category (for FINOS Landscape)
- [ ] Existing code or new Github repository
- [ ] Existing code releases (and which artifact repositories are used)
- [ ] Team composition: lead maintainer and other maintainers
- [ ] Meetings (existing/yes/no)
- [ ] Meeting minutes, agenda, attendance tracking (existing/yes/no)
- [ ] Continuous Integration (existing/yes/no)
- [ ] Documentation website (existing/yes/no)

## Maintainers, contributors and CLAs

- [ ] For each maintainer identified in the previous step, collect: the following info:
  - Fullname
  - GitHub username
  - Corporate email address
- [ ] Identify other existing contributors (assuming there's a contribution history (eg Git history)
- [ ] Check if maintainers and other contributors are all covered by FINOS CLA
- [ ] Engage with FINOS Legal team to figure out what’s needed to cover all maintainers and contributors with FINOS CLA
- [ ] Reach out to contributors and employers to coordinate CLA signatures

## Code validation (only if code is contributed)

- [ ] The codebase doesn’t have HIGH or CRITICAL CVEs across direct and transitive libraries
- [ ] The codebase doesn’t have any unfriendly licenses across direct and transitive libraries
- [ ] (optional - if a build system is provided) The build process runs successfully
- [ ] The codebase doesn’t include any patent or copyright that conflicts with FINOS Governance and bylaws (to be validated with FINOS Legal team)
- [ ] The codebase complies with FINOS Project Blueprint

## Voting

- [ ] FINOS accepts the contribution and the project can be created (or transferred)

## Code transfer and infra setup

- [ ] (optional) Transfer code assets under github.com/finos
- [ ] Add project to metadata
- [ ] Add identities, orgs and affiliations to metadata
- [ ] Invite GitHub usernames to GitHub FINOS Org
- [ ] Apply project blueprint contents - see ODP docs
- [ ] Update project badge
- [ ] Add logo to FINOS landscape
- [ ] Add project maintainers emails to finos-project-maintainers@finos.org list
- [ ] Add project maintainers GitHub usernames to the project-maintainers Team
- [ ] Enable security vulnerabilities scanning
- [ ] Enable meeting attendance tracking (optional)

## Announcement

- [ ] Work with FINOS marketing to send out announcement to community@finos.org

## Onboarding and training

- [ ] FINOS Project Governance
- [ ] FINOS Project Lifecycle
- [ ] ODP Training
