---

### 1. Create a simple configuration

Create a configuration file in a workspace with the following JSON:

```json title="proxy.config.json"
{
  "authorisedList": [
    {
      "project": "<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>",
      "name": "git-proxy",
      "url": "https://github.com/<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/git-proxy.git"
    }
  ],
}
```

Then run Git Proxy and load the configuration file from your workspace:

```bash
npx --package=@finos/git-proxy@1.1.0 -- git-proxy --config ./proxy.config.json
```

### 2. Pick a repository

Git Proxy sits between the local clone of your repository and its remote upstream. Essentially, instead of communicating directly with the live version of your repository, you configure your local clone to speak with Git Proxy first.

For demonstration purposes, we recommend forking [Git Proxy](https://github.com/finos/git-proxy/fork) and cloning the repository to your PC:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/git-proxy.git
```

### 3. Introduce Git Proxy to your clone

Navigate into your test-bed repository on your PC:

```bash
cd ./git-proxy
```

By default the clone of your repository will communicate with GitHub. To change this, so that your local copy of the repository speaks with Git Proxy, run:

```bash
git remote set-url origin http://localhost:8000/<YOUR-GITHUB-USERNAME>/git-proxy.git
```

:::note

SSH and HTTPS protocols are currently not supported. See [#27](https://github.com/finos/git-proxy/issues/27) for more.

:::

### 4. Make some changes to the codebase

Open up the `README.md` and make a change to the file.

```bash
git add README.md
git commit -m "chore: update README.md"
```

### 5. Push your changes

```bash
git push
```

#### Managing credentials

Git Proxy will prompt the entry of your git credentials. These credentials are your GitHub username and a [Personal Access Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens). For the ability to push and pull code through Git Proxy, you will only require the `public_repo` scope.

Git Proxy will reprompt you for credentials each time you push. To automatically re-use your credentials, you can run:

```bash
git config --global credential.helper osxkeychain # MacOS

git config --global credential.helper manager # Windows

git config --global credential.helper store # Linux
```

:::info

Git Proxy **does not** use your Personal Access Token other than to authenticate with GitHub when pushing code. This is identical to the process of pushing code to a repository without Git Proxy installed.

### 6. Eureka! ðŸŽ‰

Immediately after a push, you should receive a message, like this, in your terminal:

```bash
remote: Git Proxy has received your push ðŸŽ‰
remote: ----------------------------------------------------------
remote:    Commit from | 000000
remote:     Commit to  | b12557
remote:        URL     | http://localhost:8080/push/000000__b12557    
```
